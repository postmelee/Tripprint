# Tripprint
Check out where you've been in your life so far with various options
## Idea
- Photos include coordinate informations, so we can show them on a map or a globe (this is what apple does).
- We can show statistics like how many countries or cities have been(cord info), how long does user have been abroad(date info)... etc
- Little more, we can categories our users and give them an inspections. 
  - finding aspects of the places has in common so we could sugguest the next travel destination for user based on these infos.
  - using MBTI or whatever thing 
  - competition with your friend and the world, statistics with an overall score
    - fds  
- Neat UI for summering page -> sharing to other social media for showing off (marketing)

## Goals
### An app to describe who you are to the world for travelers, also friendly reminder to look back what you've done so far
