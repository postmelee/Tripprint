# Tripprint
Check out where you've been in your life so far with various options
## Idea
- Photos include coordinate informations, so we can show them on a map or a globe (this is what apple does).
- We can show users more informations like how many countries or cities have been(cord info), how long does user have been abroad(date info)... etc
- Little more, we can categories our users and give them an inspections. finding aspects of the places has in common, we could sugguest the next travel destination for user based on these infos.
- Neat UI for summering page -> sharing to other social media for showing off (marketing)

## Goals
### The app to describe who you are to the world for travelers, also friendly reminder to look back what you've done so far
